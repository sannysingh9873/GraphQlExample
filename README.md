# GraphQlExample

graphql-java-spring-boot-example
Sample app for my tutorial Building a GraphQL Server with Spring Boot.

Updated by @Sanny to recent versions of Spring Boot and GraphQL Java.

The tutorial branch contains the original demo app.

You'll need Java 11 or 17.

Clone this repo and execute mvnw spring-boot:run. Or inside an IDE, execute the class com.example.DemoGraphQL.DemoGraphQlApplication.
